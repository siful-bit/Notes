 A Javascript program is a list of **instructions** to be executed by a computer. And these programming instructions are called **statements**.

JavaScript statements are composed of:
1. [[Values]]
2. [[Operators]]
3. Expressions
4. Keywords
5. [[Comments]]

The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.


> [!Tip] Semicolons
> Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
> Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement


#### Statement can be grouped together with curly braces {...}
> This statement groups are called ***code blocks***. 

>[!Example]
> ```js
> function GroupStatement() {
> 	let a = 5; // statement 1
> 	let b = 10; // statement 2
> 	return a + b; // statement 3
> }
> ```

*The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.*
